what is container 
container is made of layers of images stacked on each other mostly linux bease image cos of their small size
What is the Image and Container
Image is the actual Package the artifact that can be moved around 
Container is the actually the application contains environment 
what is the differnce between docker and vm
vm has os applications layer and os Kernel
docker has os application layer and uses the host os kernel which make the size is smaller than vm and mush faster 
Docker Architecture
----> Docker Engine 
------> Server (Pulling Images,Managing Images & containers)
--------> Container Runtime (Pulling Images,Managing Container Lifecycle)
--------> volumes (Persisting Data)
--------> Network (Configuring Network for container communication)
--------> Build Images (Build Own Docker Images)
------> API (Interacting with docker server)
------> CLI (Command line interface client to execute docker commands)

-docker pull <image_name>
docker pull redis
-docker images 
check all exiting images
each image has name,tag (the version of the image), and id
-docker run <image_name>
start new container from specific image 
-docker run -d <image_name OR ID> 
running the container in detach mode and return the container id 
-docker run <image_name:version>
this will pull the image if not exit with spceific version and run
-docker stop <container_id>
stop docker container
-docker ps 
list of all running containers
-docker ps -a
list all the container running or not running 
-----> Port Binding
docker run -p <servies_port(pc port)>:<port_binding_to(image port)> <image_name>
docker run -p 6000:6379 redis 
this will bind redis post 6379 to 6000 port on the host pc
